## About The Project

This is a complete implementation of American Checkers that runs on the terminal. The user plays against an artifical intelligence which comes prebuilt in the game. The user can choose the difficulty of the computer, though more difficult means more computing power.

## Prerequisites

Python 3 has to be installed on your machine for you to be able to run this program. Instructions for your specific operating system can be found [here]{https://www.python.org}

## Getting Started

The program has a command line interface for input and output. The user plays against the computer as the opponent which has the color white and the user has the color red. The color of the computer is not necessarily white, because it is printed on the terminal with no formatting. That means on light themed terminals the computer can be printed black as well. The only consistent color between systems is the user's red. The user starts first for this reason.

## Usage

You can run the program by simply running the python interpreter on your system. On GNU/Linux and MacOS this would be
```
python3 main.py
```
when you are in the project directory.

On Windows, the command is
```
python main.py
```
again when in the projects directory.

After this, follow the user prompts and enjoy the game.
